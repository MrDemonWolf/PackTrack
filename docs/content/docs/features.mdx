WolfWave is packed with features to connect your Apple Music with your streaming audience.

## Music Integration

- **Last Played Tracking**: Keep history of your recently played songs

### Music Monitor Controls

## Twitch Integration

### Modern API Implementation

- **Helix API**: Full integration with Twitch's current API (no deprecated IRC)
- **OAuth Device Code Flow**: Secure authentication without entering credentials in the app

### Chat Commands

Built-in commands for your viewers:

| Command        | Description              |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `!song`        | Current playing song     |

| `!lastsong`    | Previously played song   |
| `!last`        | Previously played song   |

### Bot Features

- **Command Toggles**: Enable/disable individual commands from settings

- **Reply Support**: Commands can reply to specific messages
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles connection drops gracefully

## Discord Rich Presence

### Listening Status

Show what you're listening to directly on your Discord profile — just like Spotify, but for Apple Music.

- **"Listening to Apple Music"**: Activity type 2 displays a listening status on your profile
- **Dynamic Album Artwork**: Album art is fetched automatically from the iTunes Search API — no manual setup needed
- **Track Details**: Displays artist, song title, and album name
- **Playback Progress**: Shows elapsed time and track duration
- **Auto-connect**: Connects to Discord automatically when the app launches
- **Auto-reconnect**: Reconnects when Discord restarts or becomes available

### How It Works

WolfWave communicates with Discord via the local IPC socket — no bot token or server required. You only need a Discord Application ID from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## OBS Stream Widget

### Browser Source Overlay

Show what you're listening to directly on your stream with a built-in browser source widget for OBS.

- **Local WebSocket Server**: Runs on your Mac using Network.framework — no external services needed
- **Multi-client Support**: Multiple OBS scenes or browser tabs can connect simultaneously
- **Real-time Updates**: Track changes, progress, and playback state broadcast instantly
- **Album Art & Blur**: Displays album artwork with a blurred background overlay
- **Progress Bar**: Smooth progress bar with client-side interpolation for 60fps rendering
- **Auto-reconnect**: Widget reconnects automatically if the server restarts

### How It Works

1. Enable the WebSocket server in **Settings → OBS Widget**
2. Copy the widget URL
3. Add it as a **Browser Source** in OBS (recommended size: 500 × 120)
4. The widget connects to `ws://localhost:8765` and displays your now-playing info

### JSON Message Format

The server broadcasts structured JSON messages:
- `welcome` — Sent on initial connection
- `now_playing` — Track name, artist, album, duration, elapsed, artwork URL
- `progress` — Elapsed time updates every second during playback
- `playback_state` — Play/pause/stop state changes

## First-Launch Onboarding

A guided setup wizard walks new users through initial configuration on first launch:

1. **Welcome** — App overview with feature highlights
2. **Twitch Connection** — Optional OAuth Device Code flow to link your Twitch account
3. **Discord Rich Presence** — Optional toggle to enable listening status on Discord
4. **OBS Stream Widget** — Optional toggle to enable the WebSocket server with widget URL
