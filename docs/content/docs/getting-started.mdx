description: How to build and configure WolfWave for development
---

This guide is for developers who want to build WolfWave from source. If you just want to use WolfWave, see the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 12.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrDemonWolf/WolfWave.git
cd WolfWave
```

## Configure Twitch Client ID

Copy the example configuration file:

```bash
cp src/wolfwave/Config.xcconfig.example src/wolfwave/Config.xcconfig
```

Open `src/wolfwave/Config.xcconfig` and set your Twitch Client ID:

```
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID = your_client_id_here
```

<Callout type="info">
  Create a Twitch application at
  [dev.twitch.tv/console/apps](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) to get a
  Client ID. This is a public identifier (not a secret) that gets baked into the
  app at build time via `Info.plist`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  `Config.xcconfig` is gitignored — each contributor uses their own.
</Callout>

## Open the Project

```bash
make open-xcode
# or
open src/wolfwave.xcodeproj
```

## Build and Run

Build and run from Xcode using ⌘R.

## Production Build

For a release build with DMG output:

```bash
make prod-build TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_id
```

To build and install directly to `/Applications`:

```bash
make prod-install TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_id
```
